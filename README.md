# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression

Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. Based on the given data points, we try to plot the best fit straight line that model all the points the best.

 The line can be modelled based on the linear equation shown below:
y = a_0 + a_1 * x
