# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression

Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. Based on the given data points, we try to plot the best fit straight line that model all the points the best.

 The line can be modelled based on the linear equation :
y = a_0 + a_1 * x

The motive of the linear regression algorithm is to find the best values for a_0 and a_1. For that we will use the cost function.

## Cost Function

Since we want the best values for a_0 and a_1, we convert this search problem into a minimization problem where we would like to minimize the error between the predicted value and the actual value.
